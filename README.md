# LactateStat-Application
The LactateStat Android Application used in my master thesis: LactateStat: Wearable Electronics and User-Friendly Software for Real-Time Sweat Monitoring. Connects to my custom PCB over BLE. Can also write to relevant registers of the PCB for full control via the application. Related repositories are found on my profile.
